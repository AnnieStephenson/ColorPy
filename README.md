A taste of the plots that ColorPy can create: RGB values for the pure spectral lines.

Version 0.1.1 fork by AnnieStephenson
  Changes from 0.1.1:
    Should now work with Python 3. Does not require 1 nm spacing
    in input spectra. Can calculate a color from a reflectance spectrum,
    instead of just a power spectrum. Plotting function for color patches
    updated to require fewer parameters if desired by user. 

Version 0.1.1.
  Changes from 0.1.0:
    Various things I did on my local machine.
    A better shark fin plot, for example.
    Now on GitHub!

Version 0.1.0.
   I had this hosted at http://markkness.net
   (and still do) but GitHub is a better place for it now.
