Version 0.1.2. Changes:
  Python 3 compatible.
  Tests are much improved, and now designed to run with `python -m unittest discover`.

  Various things I did on my local machine.
  A better shark fin plot, for example.
  Now on GitHub!

Version 0.1.0.
 I had this hosted at http://markkness.net
 (and still do) but GitHub is a better place for it now.
