rayleigh.py - Rayleigh scattering

Description:

Calculation of the scattering by very small particles (compared to the wavelength).
Also known as Rayleigh scattering.
The scattering intensity is proportional to 1/wavelength^4.
It is scaled so that the scattering factor for 555.0 nm is 1.0.
This is the basic physical reason that the sky is blue.

Functions:

rayleigh_scattering (wl_nm) -
    Get the Rayleigh scattering factor for the wavelength.
    Scattering is proportional to 1/wavelength^4.
    The scattering is scaled so that the factor for wl_nm = 555.0 is 1.0.

rayleigh_scattering_spectrum () -
    Get the Rayleigh scattering spectrum (independent of illuminant), as a numpy array.

rayleigh_illuminated_spectrum (illuminant) -
    Get the spectrum when illuminated by the specified illuminant.

rayleigh_illuminated_color (illuminant) -
    Get the xyz color when illuminated by the specified illuminant.

Plots:

rayleigh_patch_plot (named_illuminant_list, title, filename) -
    Make a patch plot of the Rayleigh scattering color for each illuminant.

rayleigh_color_vs_illuminant_temperature_plot (T_list, title, filename) -
    Make a plot of the Rayleigh scattered color vs. temperature of blackbody illuminant.

rayleigh_spectrum_plot (illuminant, title, filename) -
    Plot the spectrum of Rayleigh scattering of the specified illuminant.
