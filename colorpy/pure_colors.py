# Calculation of 'pure' colors. This means both, the colors of single spectral
# lines, which are as saturated as possible, as well as the 'purples', which
# are linear combinations of pure violet and pure red. These 'purples' are
# not pure spectral lines, but they are as far from white as possible, so
# they are still considered 'pure' colors here.

# The full start and end of the visible wavelength range is 360 to 830 nm.
# However, near these endpoints, the light is poorly percieved, and so the
# color approaches zero. This means that the chromaticity is poorly defined.
# However, the chromaticity is not changing much near these endpoints.
# So, to use a start and end wavelength for the 'pure colors', it makes more
# sense to use a slightly smaller range of wavelengths.
# Wyszecki and Stiles, Color Science, p. 158 suggests that many practical
# colorimetric applications use the range 380 to 780 nm, so use that instead.

PURE_VIOLET_NM = 380.0    # Wavelength [nm] for practical 'pure' violet color.

    # as it compensates for their originally small Y. So skip this idea.
