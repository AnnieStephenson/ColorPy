misc.py - Miscellaneous color plots.

Description:

Some miscellaneous patch plot utilities, and some samples.

visible_spectrum_plot () -
    Plot the visible spectrum, as a plot vs wavelength.

cie_matching_functions_plot () -
    Plot the CIE XYZ matching functions, as three spectral subplots.

MacBeth_ColorChecker_plot () -
    MacBeth ColorChecker Chart.
    The xyz values are from Hall p. 119.  I do not know for what lighting conditions this applies.

chemical_solutions_patch_plot () -
    Colors of some chemical solutions.
    Darren L. Williams et. al., 'Beyond lambda-max: Transforming Visible Spectra into 24-bit Color Values'.
        Journal of Chemical Education, Vol 84, No 11, Nov 2007, p1873-1877.
    A student laboratory experiment to measure the transmission spectra of some common chemical solutions,
    and determine the rgb values.

universe_patch_plot () -
    The average color of the universe.
    Karl Glazebrook and Ivan Baldry
        http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/  (accessed 17 Sep 2008)
    The color of the sum of all light in the universe.
    This originally caused some controversy when the (correct) xyz color was incorrectly reported as light green.
    The authors also consider several other white points, here we just use the default (normally D65).

This file is part of ColorPy.
