Changes in versions of ColorPy.

Desired future improvements:
    * Addition of BSD license.
	* Publishing on PyPi.
	* Travis-CI?
	* Atomic spectra.

New in 0.2.0:
    This release introduces some minor compatibility changes,
	which allow significant performance improvements.
	This version should be compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.
	
	* New Spectrum() class type.
	The main change is the Spectrum() class type.
	This replaces the simple N by 2 array spectrum format.
	This gives the wavelength and intensity arrays more meaningful names,
	and allows some metadata to be added to the array data.
	This allows some faster calculations when the wavelength list is standard.
	The new and old structures are closely related, and there are calls
	to make it easy to convert between them.

	* Unit test improvements.
    The tests are substantially improved in general. They are now designed
	to be run via standard test runners, e.g. 'python -m unittest discover'.
	However you can still run tests.py to exercise them.

    * Minor rearrangements.
	Since some compatibility breaking changes were required, this seemed
	a good time to make some minor rearrangements that also are breaking,
	but should be very easy to adjust to.
	[Nothing so far, expect renaming and moving functions around.]

	* Various internal improvements.
	General refactoring that improves the code, but should not require any
	adjustments in your code.
		
	Compatibility:
	This version has some changes that could break code using the older versions.
	* Spectrum() class.

New in 0.1.2:
    This is effectively what is on GitHub now in master.
