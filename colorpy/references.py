'''
Setup the conversions between CIE XYZ and linear RGB spaces.
The conversion is defined by supplying the chromaticities of each of
the monitor phosphors, as well as the resulting white color when all
of the phosphors are at full strength.
See [Foley/Van Dam, p.587, eqn 13.27, 13.29] and [Hall, p. 239].
