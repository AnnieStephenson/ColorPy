plots.py - Various types of plots.

Description:

Functions to draw various types of plots for light spectra.

Functions:

log_interpolate (y0, y1, num_values) -
    Return a list of values, num_values in size, logarithmically interpolated
    between y0 and y1. The first value will be y0, the last y1.

tighten_x_axis (x_list) -
    Tighten the x axis (only) of the current plot to match the given range of x values.
    The y axis limits are not affected.

General plots:

rgb_patch_plot (
    rgb_colors,
    color_names,
    title,
    filename,
    patch_gap = 0.05,
    num_across = 6) -
    Draw a set of color patches, specified as linear rgb colors.

xyz_patch_plot (
    xyz_colors,
    color_names,
    title,
    filename,
    patch_gap = 0.05,
    num_across = 6) -
    Draw a set of color patches specified as xyz colors.

spectrum_subplot (spectrum) -
    Plot a spectrum, with x-axis the wavelength, and y-axis the intensity.
    The curve is colored at that wavelength by the (approximate) color of a
    pure spectral color at that wavelength, with intensity constant over wavelength.
    (This means that dark looking colors here mean that wavelength is poorly viewed by the eye.
    This is not a complete plotting function, e.g. no file is saved, etc.
    It is assumed that this function is being called by one that handles those things.

spectrum_plot (
    spectrum,
    title,
    filename,
    xlabel = 'Wavelength ($nm$)',
    ylabel = 'Intensity ($W/m^2$)') -

    Plot for a single spectrum -
    In a two part graph, plot:
    top: color of the spectrum, as a large patch.
    low: graph of spectrum intensity vs wavelength (x axis).
    The graph is colored by the (approximated) color of each wavelength.
    Each wavelength has equal physical intensity, so the variation in
    apparent intensity (e.g. 400, 800 nm are very dark, 550 nm is bright),
    is due to perceptual factors in the eye.  This helps show how much
    each wavelength contributes to the percieved color.

    spectrum - spectrum to plot
    title    - title for plot
    filename - filename to save plot to
    xlabel   - label for x axis
    ylabel   - label for y axis

color_vs_param_plot (
    param_list,
    rgb_colors,
    title,
    filename,
    tight    = False,
    plotfunc = pyplot.plot,
    xlabel   = 'param',
    ylabel   = 'RGB Color') -

    Plot for a color that varies with a parameter -
    In a two part figure, draw:
    top: color as it varies with parameter (x axis)
    low: r,g,b values, as linear 0.0-1.0 values, of the attempted color.

    param_list - list of parameters (x axis)
    rgb_colors - numpy array, one row for each param in param_list
    title      - title for plot
    filename   - filename to save plot to
    plotfunc   - optional plot function to use (default matplotlib.pyplot.plot)
    xlabel     - label for x axis
    ylabel     - label for y axis (default 'RGB Color')
