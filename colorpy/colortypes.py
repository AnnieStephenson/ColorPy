'''
colortypes.py - Basic types for colors.

Description:

The models store color values as 3-element NumPy vectors.
The values are stored as floats, except for irgb, which are stored as integers.

Functions:

'Constructor-like' functions:

xyz_color (x, y, z = None) -
    Construct an xyz color.  If z is omitted, set it so that x+y+z = 1.0.

xyz_normalize (xyz) -
    Scale so that all values add to 1.0.
    This both modifies the passed argument and returns the normalized result.

xyz_normalize_Y1 (xyz) -
    Scale so that the y component is 1.0.
    This both modifies the passed argument and returns the normalized result.

xyz_color_from_xyY (x, y, Y) -
    Given the 'little' x,y chromaticity, and the intensity Y,
    construct an xyz color.  See Foley/Van Dam p. 581, eq. 13.21.

rgb_color (r, g, b) -
    Construct a linear rgb color from components.

irgb_color (ir, ig, ib) -
    Construct a displayable integer irgb color from components.

luv_color (L, u, v) -
    Construct a Luv color from components.

lab_color (L, a, b) -
    Construct a Lab color from components.
